# Script Stubs

Future scripts will operationalize the preprocessing plan after design sign-off:
- `ingest_text`: pull and normalize text metadata.
- `ingest_video`: fetch video assets and extract agreed representations.
- `build_manifest`: assemble combined manifests with checksums and splits.
- `validate_splits`: run integrity and coverage checks before release.

Implementation will be added after architecture approval.
